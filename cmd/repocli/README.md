# repocli: cross-platform CLI for managing the Donders Repository data

A command-line tool for performing basic operations on the data content (not the metadata) of the Donders Repository collections.  In essense, it uses the WebDAV protocol to implemente the operations; therefore it is also a genetic tool for managing data accessible via WebDAV with the HTTP basic authentication (e.g. [SURFDrive](https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/SURFdrive/Accessing+files+via+WebDAV)).

The following operations are currently implemented:

- ls: list a directory
- mkdir: create a new directory
- cp: copy a file or a directory
- mv: rename a file or a directory
- rm: remove a file or a directory
- get: download a file or a directory
- put: upload a file or a directory

When performing recursive operation on a directory, the tool does a directory walk-through and applies the operation on individual files in parallel.  This approach breaks down a lengthy bulk-operation request into multiple shorter, less resource demanding requests.  It helps improve the overall success rate of the operation.

```

__The configuration file__

The credential (username and password) of the data-access account should be provided in a configuration file (specified by the `-c` option) in the YAML format.  The default location of this configuration file is `${HOME}/.repocli.yml` on Linux/MacOSX and `C:\Users\<username>\.repocli.yml` on Windows.  Since the program expects that the password stored in the configuration file is encrypted, it is better to use the following command to generate (or overwrite) the file:

```bash
$ repocli login
```

You will be asked to provide the WebDAV's baseURL, username and password.  After providing those values, type `y` to save the credential to the configuration file.  Once it is done successfully, you can reuse the configuration file in the future to connect to the same WebDAV endpoint.

💡You can use the `login` subcommand with the `-c` option to create multiple configuration files, each for a different WebDAV endpoint.

❗The password in the configuration file is encrypted with the signatures of the file path and the username.  Changes on the signatures (e.g. renaming the configuration file) will make the password invalid.

__The shell mode__

In addition to run the program's subcommands as individual shell commands (single-command mode), the CLI can also be used as an interactive shell (shell mode).  One uses the `shell` command to enter the shell mode:

```bash
$ repocli shell
```

The CLI's specific prompt `> repocli` will be displayed as the screenshot below, waiting for furhter commands from the user.

![screenshot of the shell mode](screenshot-shell.png)

In the shell mode, the following additional operations are enabled:

- cd: change the present working directory in the repository
- pwd: show the present working directory in the repository
- lcd: change the present working directory at local
- lpwd: show the present working directory at local
- lls: list content in the present working directory at local

Hereafter are examples showcasing how to use various subcommands.  You can find more detailed and up-to-date usage via the `help` subcommand.  For example, the online help of the `get` subcommand can be found by:

```bash
$ repocli help get
```

### listing a directory

Given a collection with identifier `di.dccn.DAC_3010000.01_173`, the WebDAV directory in which the collection data is stored is `/dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173`.  To list the content of this WebDAV directory, one does

```bash
$ repocli ls -l /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173
/dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173:
 drwxrwxr-x            0 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/Cropped
 drwxrwxr-x            0 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/raw
 drwxrwxr-x            0 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/test1
 drwxrwxr-x            0 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/test2021
 drwxrwxr-x            0 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/test3
 drwxrwxr-x            0 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/test_loc.new
 drwxrwxr-x            0 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/test_sync
 drwxrwxr-x            0 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/testx
 drwxrwxr-x            0 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/xyz.5
 drwxrwxr-x            0 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/xyz.x
 -rw-rw-r--          203 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/MANIFEST.txt.1
 -rw-rw-r--       191503 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/MD5E-s191503--8661ce04ccbbf51e96ce124e30fc0c8c.txt
 -rw-rw-r--     49152352 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/MP2RAGE.nii
 -rw-rw-r--         2589 /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/Makefile
...
```

### removing a file or directory

Assuming that we want to remove the file `MANIFEST.txt.1` from the collection content listed above, we do

```bash
$ repocli rm /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/MANIFEST.txt.1
```

If we want to remove the entire sub-directory `testx`, we use the command

```bash
$ repocli rm -r /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/textx
```

where the extra flag `-r` indicates recursive removal.

### creating a directory

To create a subdirectory `demo` in the collection, we do

```bash
$ repocli mkdir /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo
```

One could also create a directory tree use the same command, any missing parent directories will also be created (similar to the `mkdir -p` command on Linux).  For example, if we want to create a directory tree `demo1/data/sub-001/ses-mri01`, we do

```bash
$ repocli mkdir /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo1/data/sub-001/ses-mri01
```

It can be done with or without the existence of the parent tree structure `demo1/data/sub-001`.

### uploading/download a single file

For uploading/downloading a single file to/from the collection in the repository.  One use the `put` and `get` sub-commands, respectively.  The `put` and `get` sub-commands require two arguments.  The first argument refers to the _source_ path; while the second to the _destination_ path.

The WebDAV path should always be in form of the absolute path (i.e. started with `/`); while the local path can be in a format recognized by the shell.

For example, to upload a local file `test.txt` in the present working directory to `/dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo/test.txt`, one does

```bash
$ repocli put ./test.txt /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo/test.txt
```

To download a remote file `/dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo/test.txt` to `test.txt.new` in the home directory at local (refered by the `$HOME` variable), one does

```bash
$ repocli get /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo/test.txt $HOME/test.txt.new
```

If the destination is a directory, file will be downloaded/uploaded into the directory with the same name.  If the destination is an existing file, the file will be overwritten by the content of the source.

### resursive uploading/downloading a directory

Assuming that we have a local directory `/project/3010000.01/demo`, and we want to upload the content of it recursively to the collection under the sub-directory `demo`.  We use the command below:

```bash
$ repocli put /project/3010000.01/demo/ /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo
```

where the first argument to `put` is a directory locally as the _source_, and the second is a directory in the repository as the _destination_.

For downloading a directory from the repository, one does

```bash
$ repocli get /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo/ /project/3010000.01/demo.new
```

where the first argument is a directory in the repository as the source, and the second is a local directory as the destination.

__Note:__ The same as the `rsync` command, the tailing `/` in the _source_ instructs the tool to _copy the content_ into the destination.  If the tailing `/` is left out, it will _copy the directory by name_ in to the destination, resulting in the content being put into a (new) sub-directory in the destination.

### moving (i.e. renaming) a file or a directory

For renaming a file within a collection, one uses the `mv` sub-command.  This sub-command also takes two arguments, the _source_ and the _destniation_.

For example, if we want to rename a file `/dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/test.txt` to `/dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/test.txt.old` in the repository, we do

```bash
$ repocli mv /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/test.txt /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/test.txt.old
```

We could also rename an entire directory.  For example, if we want to rename a `/dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo` to `/dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo.new`, we use the command below (__note the tailing `/` of the _source_ for "moving the content over"__):

```bash
$ repocli mv /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo/ /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo.new
```

Moving the _source_ directory into a the _destination_ directory can be achived by leaving the tailing `/` out the _source_ directory.  Taking the example above, if the tailing `/` is omitted, e.g.

```bash
$ repocli mv /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo /dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo.new
```

the end result will a new directory `/dccn/DAC_3010000.01_173/demo.new/demo` in which the data within the _source_ directory are moved over.
